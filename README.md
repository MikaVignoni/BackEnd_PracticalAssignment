# BackEnd_PracticalAssignment
Practical Assignment for the course in Academia Numen

This project aims to simulate some basic aspects that might be required for a veterinary clinic. It includes a query to an external API that returns random data about cats, which could be used to display on the footer and/or landing page. Additionally, it collects information for each patient, with the pets being the patients. There is a space provided to leave notes for each consultation, and the information of the pet owners is stored for contacting them in case of emergencies.



Given that it's part of an academic activity, the project had to meet the following requirements:

Project integration guidelines for BackEnd:

Have its own database and account on MongoDB Atlas.
Develop the project with a Node server that uses routes with their respective HTTP methods for communication with the database.
Have an original and custom schema.
Have at least 4 routes that form a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Validate necessary routes using express-validator.
Develop a custom middleware.
Have a route that communicates with an external API.
